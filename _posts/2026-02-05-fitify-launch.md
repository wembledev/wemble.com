## Launching Fitify - Fitness for People Who Hate Fitness

{{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

We just launched [Fitify](https://fitify.ca), and honestly, I'm already tired from clicking the deploy button. 🛋️

It's a fitness app for people who think "fitness app" sounds exhausting. Which... fair.

### The Concept

**Micro-workouts disguised as normal life.** No gym. No spandex. No one yelling at you about your macros.

The idea is simple: you're already doing stuff throughout your day. Walking to the mailbox. Doing dishes. Waiting for coffee to brew. What if all that stuff secretly counted as exercise?

Turns out it does. We just wrote it down and made it slightly more intentional.

### Some Example Tips

Here are a few of our favorites:

<div class="tip-card">
🐕 <strong>The Guilt-Free Dog Walk</strong><br>
Your dog's been staring at you for 20 minutes. Take the hint. Go around the block. If you feel ambitious, go around it twice — but honestly once is fine.
<em>Secret: 15-20 min of cardio. Your heart rate went up. Shhh.</em>
</div>

<div class="tip-card">
🧽 <strong>The Dish Disco</strong><br>
Put on a playlist while doing the dishes. You'll move your hips. You'll bob your head. You'll air-drum with a spatula. It's inevitable.
<em>Secret: Light movement while standing + arm work from scrubbing = stealth workout.</em>
</div>

<div class="tip-card">
🪥 <strong>The Toothbrush Squat</strong><br>
While brushing your teeth (2 min, right? RIGHT?), do slow squats. Nobody can see you. The bathroom door is closed. Go nuts.
<em>Secret: That's 15-20 bodyweight squats. Your quads are confused but grateful.</em>
</div>

<div class="tip-card">
🛒 <strong>The Basket Hero</strong><br>
At the store, carry a basket instead of pushing a cart. Even if you're buying a lot. Especially if you're buying a lot.
<em>Secret: Constant farmer's carry. Your biceps and forearms are shopping too.</em>
</div>

### All the Tips. Zero Judgment.

Browse by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Sneaky, or Legendary), or by body focus. Save your favorites. Get personalized recommendations based on your lifestyle.

### It's Free. For Now.

No subscriptions. No "unlock premium to breathe correctly." No ads. No crypto. (The AI suggested crypto. We said no.)

It won't always be free — maybe it will, who knows — but **get tips while you can!** Because fitness guilt shouldn't come with a price tag.

### The Build

This was a solo build — one developer plus AI agents who don't sleep and occasionally suggest adding blockchain features. The entire thing was designed, built, and launched in a few weeks.

It's the kind of project that makes you wonder why more apps aren't just... simpler. Useful. And not trying to extract $9.99/month from your pocket.

### Try It

**[fitify.ca](https://fitify.ca)** — Go ahead. Your couch called. It said try one.
