## Launching Fitnito - Revolutionizing Scheduling for Gym Owners

{{ page.date | date: "%B %-d, %Y" }}

We’re thrilled to announce the launch of [Fitnito](https://fitnito.com), our new gym scheduling solution designed specifically for gym owners! 🎉

**Fitnito** is a simple yet powerful application that helps you manage your classes, clients, and passes with ease. Built with a user-friendly interface and a suite of robust features, Fitnito is perfect for gym owners looking to streamline their operations and grow their business.

### The Development Journey

Fitnito was developed in late 2023 to help a local gym owner transition from an expensive and complex scheduling system to a more affordable and efficient solution. Through a smooth and collaborative development process, we were able to deliver a platform that maintained essential functionalities while significantly reducing costs.

Our team at Wemble worked closely with the gym owner to understand their needs, which allowed us to create a solution that truly meets the demands of gym management. We’re excited to share that the gyms using Fitnito have already seen remarkable results. They’ve experienced significant time savings, fewer scheduling errors, and increased client satisfaction.
